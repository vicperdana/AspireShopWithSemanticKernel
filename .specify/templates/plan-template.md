# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: C# .NET 9.0 with Aspire hosting framework  
**Primary Dependencies**: Microsoft Agent Framework, Microsoft.Agents.AI, Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI, Aspire  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (catalog data), Redis (session/basket data)  
**Testing**: xUnit, Moq, coverlet for coverage analysis  
**Target Platform**: Azure Container Apps, local Docker via Aspire
**Project Type**: microservices - distributed service architecture  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms API response time, support concurrent AI chat sessions  
**Constraints**: Cost-efficient AI token usage, secure credential management, container resource limits  
**Scale/Scope**: Demo/sample application, 5+ microservices, Azure cloud deployment ready

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Service-First Architecture**: Feature designed as independently deployable service with clear boundaries
- [ ] **AI-First Integration**: If AI functionality included, uses Microsoft Agent Framework with IChatClient abstraction
- [ ] **Test-Driven Development**: xUnit test plan included, minimum 80% coverage target set
- [ ] **Microservice Boundaries**: Service aligns with business domain, no cross-database access
- [ ] **Observability & Monitoring**: Structured logging, health checks, and telemetry plan included

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
